        Keen IT graduate with knowledge in Information Technology. 
        With a second-class upper in Electronics and Computer Engineering 
        from Lagos State University. I have a working knowledge of  
        programming and web development, and I am eager to pursue a 
        career in the software development industry. I have a range of 
        skill sets which would be beneficial to any employer within that 
        space. Having completed some projects during my studies and 
        personal projects such as an Attendance management 
        system using QR code, I know I can add value to any IT department.
